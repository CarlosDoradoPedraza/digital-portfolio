<h1 style="color: white">About me </h1>
<hr>
<br>
<p style="color: white">I'm passionate about technology and with continuing to improve my skills to always be informed of the latest trends. Everything I do is always focus on the <b>design</b> and <b>management of projects</b> and I always try to give the maximum of me even if it is not neccesary because i hard believe this is the best way to keep pushing myself to improve my skills and im always glad to hear and <b>listen to people feedback</b> in order to keep progressing.</p>

<p style="color: white">One of my hobbies is the management of my <b>Youtube channel</b> that with my effor i manage to have 1700 subs currently, the reason to do this was to do it to challenge myself and develop my skills, suchs as design thumbnails, edit videos, recieve feedback and watch my channel statistics and understand what users like the most.</p>

<p style="color: white">Another of my key skills would be <b>self-learning</b> this is the thing I love the most because allow me to learn different things for free that I wouldnt be able to pay or waste time to travel to have a course. </p>

<p style="color: white">I'm <b>hard motivated</b> to one day be able to show up everything I have  learned, I spent a lot of time of my life doing this and this is what most makes me happy. </p>
